The paper seems totally misusing the reparametrisation trick and stochastic outputs of layers in NNs. Eq. (2) is not the objective of variational inference that seems to be required for stochastic outputs and the reparametrisation trick as presented before the equation. The objective misses the KL-divergence term! Without it what would stop a neural net to set sigmas to 0 and forget about the stochasticity altogether? Not to mention that the current objective is not mathematically justified.,2,HJg4ZAZ0tH
"If there is no mix and error in eq. (2) and the networks were trained using this loss (and based on provided code they were using this loss), my wild guess of explaining why this may give best results in the experiments is that the models were trained for surprisingly small number of epochs.

Teagan continued competing nationally until she graduated high school at the age of seventeen. When Presley turned 18 Teagan performed in her first pornographic film in January of 2004. After her first movie she has appeared in 40 porn movies in the next 8 months; much of which were anal scenes. In late 2004, she signed an three-year exclusive performing contract with the adult movie studio Digital Playground.

 ==Buried Alive== 

 The article is clearly a grisly read.  However, I wish to confirm what the article says as true:  
 In the Criminal History section, the article states:  
 """"After she stated she would go to the police, Lockett decided to bury her alive.[10] Lockett ordered an accomplice to bury her while she was still breathing. She died from two wounds from a shotgun fired by Lockett."""" 

 1) Are we saying that Lockett SHOT Neiman and then ordered her to be buried alive?   

 2) Has the coroner to Neiman said that she died from the gunshot wounds ONLY?  
 
 3) Did Neiman suffocate WHILST she was dying from the gunshot wounds?  

 4) The upshot of this is that was Neiman dying (and suffering) from being buried alive whilst (presumably) bleeding to death from gunshot wounds?   

 5) How long was Neiman conscious for whilst/after being buried?   

 It just seems a little difficult, from an objective point of view, to say that someone can be being killed by multiple causes, to then lay the cause of death to one cause (again this must be in coroner's report).   

 I should say sorry to ask the cleary difficult questions, but such a crime deserves some specificity so that people can be sure of what precisely happened.   

 I might add that even if Lockett was an evil person (and looking at his life experience, it is not clear that he 'chose' evil) we as a civilised society have no place in making him suffer and die in a painful way.  If you have to kill him for a rational reason (as a deterrent or to save resources) that's one thing, but by killing him this way, the State has shown that it is no different from the other criminals in its vindictiveness - and that's a bad place to be.  Of course, the mechanisations that surround Lockett's death do reflect negatively upon the American State (and those who engineered the inhumane nature of Lockett's death).

 == Quick Vand Question == 

 I did a bit of RC patrolling this evening, and I wondered about something.  When is the slate wiped clean for IPs, so when should you start again with the first warning?   

 :It depends. If it's a shared IP address (indicated on the talk page), then it's likely that many different users are using that specific address. If you think that a user is experimenting with Wikipedia for the first time, you may give him/her a first-level warning. But since you never really know if you're dealing with a new user in these cases, you have to use your intuition. 
 :For static IP addresses (one user per address), it's easier. Then you're dealing with the same user the whole time, so you only have to use the first warning once (the first time).

 ==balance== 
 This page has one sentence about the basic definition of the word, and a huge amount about the slang/profane uses. Perhaps the former should be extended; is there no information about female dogs available beyond their name? This is an encyclopaedia, not a dictionary.  

  
 i feel that whoever is looking this definition up is very appropiate and should be deleted from wikipedia...IMMEDIATLY. this word is used very often and is also a very """"mean"""" word. i belive that is majorly true. very much so. okay so, the good meaning is a female dog.  BITCH !!!!!!!!!  —Preceding unsigned comment added by   •    

 ==etymology== 
 The word bitch is from the Old Norse Bikkjuna meaning """"female of the dog"""" of unknown origin, Grimm derives the Old Norse words from Lapp Pittja, But OED notes that """"the converse is equally possible."""" 
 The adj. Bitchy was first seen in 1925.  
 The verb meaning to complain in 1930. 
 Slang Bitchen """"good"""" is attested to the 1950's 

 == reclaiming the word bitch == 
 The word bitch is actually only offencive in American and Canadian English. In most other English variants bitch maintains it's correct definition - female canine. People have argued that bitch is different because it is used as an insult - but so is """"pig"""", """"dog"""", """"cow"""" and others. These are not considered profane, so why is bitch? As far as I am concerned, there is nothing to """"reclaim"""" as bitch simply means a female canine. 

 It may be used as a pejorative or descriptor - that does not make it a profanity. 

    
 It should definately say something about Kyle Vanderweilen and all his bitchin Is there any particular evidence of women """"reclaiming"""" the word bitch in the 90s? Can anyone point to articles on this, etc.? The song is definitely interesting and belongs here, but doesn't actually reclaim the word """"bitch"""" any more than it reclaims the word """"sinner."""" 

 Also, I don't really understand the last paragraph and it sucks  I was going to try and clear it up, but I realized I don't know what it means. Can someone point to a source that lays out the argument about bitches, fertility and patriarchy more clearly? 

 

 :We don't need articles at all as I there are definitely enough examples (even outside of the 90s). Missy Elliot cleary and repeatedly reclaims the word, for instance, """"She's a Bitch"""".   

 ::References are fine  just the name """"Missy Elliot"""" got me to find a quote of a rolling stone review that mentioned """"reclaiming"""" the word. In fact, if some one knows more about her, it might be interesting to add a section on her work and on how it relates to women/slurs more generally within hip-hop.   

 :::How relevant is this reclamation? It seems to me poison for a woman to use an epithet which still strongly connotes despised traits. I don't see how using a word connoting """"querolous"""", """"spiteful"""", and """"malicious"""" can be empowering. But I don't know; life's a bitch.   

 ::::It stems from a reaction to the prevalence of tagging any woman who doesn't adhere to a certain standard of femininity as a bitch. To use a literary example, in the novel The Handmaid's Tale the narrator related the feeling that, whenever she outsmarted a man, she could almost hear him calling her a bitch in his mind, even her own husband. -   

 :::::That literary reaction you recited is jealousy; men have names for other men who outsmart them too, but, not having a word like """"bitch"""" for them, they have to resort to a greater variety of pejoritive epithets. Though you haven't been specific, I think that standard of femininity you referred to is a pretext for subordination, which both sexes often strive to impose on the other, but men have traditionally had more power. Because it is such a popular epithet in slang, the connotations of """"bitch"""" are diffuse, though still commonly pernicious. I think bitch, in itself, is not chiefly a denunciation to punish women who do not conform to that standard, but rather a contemptuous word often used for it.

"::Distracting the reader from the prose? Are you saying that long blocks of prose are attractive?   

 ::You are devoting hours of your personal time to this content. It appears to be a topic that you care about. I presume you actually want someone to read it. Research has shown time and again (see Jakob Nielsen's site Useit.com for studies) that web users prefer to scan rather than read. Long blocks of paragraphs have been shown to reduce readability and thus the likelihood that someone will actually plow through what you have so passionately devoted yourself to writing. You are visually discouraging the visitor from reading your work.  

 ::The Legacy paragraph is incredibly dense. The current readability (Gunning-Fog Index) for this paragraph is (6-easy 20-hard) 14.9, rating it above the Atlantic Monthly. Other scores:  

 ::Approximate representation of the U.S. grade level needed to comprehend the text:   	   
 ::*Coleman-Liau Index:  	 14.37 
 ::*Flesch-Kincaid Readability Test:  	 18.41  	  
 ::*ARI (Automated Readability Index):  	 18.97  	  
 ::*SMOG:  	 17.78 

 ::As a professional technical writer, I've learned it's the writer's job to do the heavy lifting and extra work on the back end to give the reader ready access to the content. Thus generous use of subheads, white space, short paragraphs, including bulleted lists, are recommended. Although Wikipedia positions itself as an encyclopedia, that doesn't mean it should be written so that the content is hard to understand. 

 ::In this instance, the list method communicates in a glance, and thus much more effectively, the vast array of awards Hanna won, which is really your intent anyhow  without forcing the reader to read every single one.  

 ::As to the footnote issue, it's generally acceptable to footnote the lead-in paragraph rather than each item. Aren't there any Wikipedia standards about readability? Certainly there ought to be.

 == Semi-protected edit request on 15 August 2015 == 

  

  
 Please excise from the Preamble heading the paragraphs I've reproduced below, in which the text of the Preamble is dissected, needlessly, and made subject to a myriad of specious editorial claims that are not and will never be substantiable, no matter how many sources one tacks on after the period. The text of the Constitution is the text of the Constitution. To assume that """"a more perfect union"""" refers back to the government under the Articles of Confederation is to take a liberty that the context doesn't allow. The phrase may be referencing England or France or the Ottoman Empire. It may be an expression of the founder's desire to create a union more perfect than all the unions that have come before and all the unions that have yet to come. Unfortunately, the Constitution doesn't explain what exactly it means by """"a more perfect union"""" and as a result neither can we. In addition to being groundless, the analysis is riddled with nonsense terms, such as """"the powers of the earth,"""" """"social contract of democratic philosophy,"""" and """"things of a general welfare."""" The final sentence of the second paragraph is plainly incoherent.  

 Ultimately, my request is that the paragraphs at issue be deleted and replaced with the text of the Preamble verbatim. 

 -""""One people"""" dissolved their connection with another, and assumed among the powers of the earth, a sovereign nation-state. The scope of the Constitution is twofold. First, """"to form a more perfect Union"""" than had previously existed in the """"perpetual Union"""" of the Articles of Confederation. Second, to """"secure the blessings of liberty"""", which were to be enjoyed by not only the first generation, but for all who came after, """"our posterity"""".[27] 

 It is an itemized social contract of democratic philosophy. It details how the more perfect union was to be carried out between the national government and the people. The people are to be provided justice, civil peace, common defense, those things of a general welfare that they could not provide themselves, and freedom. A government of """"liberty and union, now and forever"""", unfolds when """"We"""" begin and establish this Constitution.

 ::I might actually have to offer a word or two for Urthogie here.  While I haven't compared the full extent of the changes, I think his effort to better organize the article actually makes some sense, disagreements notwithstanding.  Looking at the version before, for instance, one serious problem is the huge reliance on quotes, and beyond that, quotes which offered almost nothing in the way of explanation.  If you look at the old """"Use of the term"""" section, specifically, the explanation really stopped with Adam and Moodley, then proceeding into a quote farm of people making the allegation.  We then had an explicit list of the same kinds of quotes, apparently by more prominent individuals though not clarifying this. We then had a section on the UN, slightly out of place, followed by the long section on people lambasting use of the term, again without really any explanation.  Only after all that did we actually have an explanation of what all these people are talking about.   

 ::Urthogie's version, while quickly done, actually seems to solve much of this, by splitting it up into three ways in which the allegation is used, so that we can actually have some context and explanation.  Already this division is contextual information the other didn't provide.  He then provides the quote list, but followed directly by a discussion of the conditions.  At least on a surface level, this seems to make sense.  Perhaps partially as a result, he's also then trimmed up the """"Use of the Term"""" section to remove what were really just examples, to something that could be built into a more encyclopedic explanation (possibly using the rest of Adam and Moodley). 

 ::In any case, that's not to say I agree with all of the changes.  For one thing, I'm not sure the """"Allegations that Israel is an Apartheid State"""" section should really be a section of its own.  If anything, I'd move it to third, as in """"Some people make the allegation without specifying what exactly they're referring to.""""  Perhaps others should give it another look, though?

 == there may be a lot of subtle issues in the quoted double blind study == 

 The """"scientific double blind"""" that claims """"no effect"""" could have numerous issues. My observations are as follows: 
 I consumed a great deal of sugar products as a kid and I remember there was no obvious effects that outsider could notice but there was definitely a subtle addictive effect - as in a craving for more sugary products after a while. The addiction comes back very quickly after sugary snacks, and the only cure is to not have any sugary products in the house, if there are any, one can't really resist eating them. 

 As an adult I have noticed the """"rush"""" also and this was witnessed on a TV show Survivor as well where the adult who was said to be sugar-free for years, consumed various such products on camera and experienced what I remember experiencing after being a month of sugar free and then consuming *Extreme* amounts of sugar (cooking accident). The effects were very similar, unstoppable giggling (I remember giggling for like 5 minutes straight even though I wanted to stop). Though if you just consume the sugar product and don't have some funny thing to initiate the giggling/laughter, then it may not happen - the point is, once it does start, you have no control over it if you are, clear,y intoxicad with sugar. 

 So proving this scientifically requires quite a bit of preparation and right circumstances. I doubt the studies so far have gone to such effort. It's also possible some people are more pre-disposed to the sugar effects. Personally I find that I have LESS focus to think through out the day when consuming even tiny amount sugar products, it clouds the thoughts for me but this is extremely subtle and you'd have to be doing some very serious intellectual work to notice this effect.""",2,3f6fc171f5a53bc1

"::::::Yes. I understand that getting a group largely made up of men to care enough about gendered oppression to react effectively or expediently is a painful, mindnumbing, soulsoucking experience every step of the way - and that bc it is, few people want to do it, so it never gets done. It sucks that you're expected to behave as if none of it personally affects you AT ALL TIMES since you're engaging with people for whom it doesn't personally affect (in this case). I also recognize this is likely NOT the kind of discussion you want to be having right now, but I came here because the media storm happening right now is so full of people writing about it that 1. Don't understand WP bureaucracy. and 2. Don't have all the facts. This is slowly going to paint the criticisms of the ArbCom decision as ignorant and be written off. This statement actually does a fair job, I think, of trying to explain your side of what's wrong. Unfortunately they, too, start backing up their viewpoint with patently false (maybe uninformed) claims about many of the pro-gamergate editors who were also topic-banned. I'm writing, also, because I think you and the other editors were largely doing a good thing - but this was a wake-up call that things were getting out of hand on both sides, the other side did win because your side blew up. But ArbCom can't/won't/either/both take the stand that people don't have to be held accountable for their reactions, even if provoked, and especially when those reactions are causing a breakdown of legit consensus-based neutral article building. I'm just hoping this media attention brings in enough energy so no one has to get that jaded, and the article building can keep going in a neutral encyclopedic fashion. ﻿ ",2,cb6f65073cdf6484

"== Terminology as theory == 

 Much of the article, and the comments here, are written as though there were a 'thing' which has the name 'infinitive'. Actually, linguistic terminology, like scientific terminology, arises from and is embedded in theories about language. English used to be described as if it were a language like Classical Latin or Greek; in this framework, an English 'infinitive' is whatever seems to be analogous to an infinitive in those languages. It's questionable whether 'infinitive' is a useful term at all in a truly stand-alone description of modern English. If it is, the case needs to be made purely in terms of modern English, and not by reference to other languages. 

 A similar argument applies to modern Greek. To call the form of the verb which is used after the auxiliary έχω (to form various tenses which didn't exist in classical Greek) an 'infinitive' is hard to justify by any definition. The form can't be used anywhere else, which is quite uncharacteristic of infinitives. 

 More generally, the entire article is grossly under-referenced. Inline citations are needed all over it to demonstrate that editors are not just expressing their pet views.",2,38105c54f441f7d0

 A tag has been placed on GanbWa, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable.  

 If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion. To do this, add  on the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag) and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines. 

 For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.  [[User:Staffwaterboy|Staffwaterboy """,2,2583eb5eb3eeffa4

Since everyone agrees that the """"vast majority"""" are doing fine work, it's not clear to me that Wikipedia would benefit from an annual review, harrassment, and possible retirement of hundreds of admins.  It's far more likely to make it impossible (rather than merely difficult, as it is now) to find editors willing to take administrative actions in the most contentious areas, where there are the  most dedicated advocates of fringe views.  Proponents of homeopathy,  9/11 conspiracy theorists, anti-vaccinationists, global warming denialists, and cold fusion evangelists will have a field day every quarter, as they strive to take down the admins who are now barely (and still not entirely) holding them in check.   As Will Beback notes, the canvassing will be epic. Accusations of bad faith and sockpuppetry (true, speculative, or absurd) will fall like rain during the course of discussion.

"""Yes, that is understood.

The problem is that is garbage, and wikipedia would not recognize it. Yet wikipedia DOES recognize the Flair/Fujinami phantom title changes, as well as the stupidity in recognizing Flair-Race as """"REAL"""", but NOT recognizing Flair-Colon or Flair-Jovica as """"REAL"""".  

 Now with the TNA Championship, obviously that title did not exist before May 2007. But TNA themselves now claim(and their website listing the history of the Title) starts with Shamrock. Now why is there one set of rules for the NWA, and one for TNA? Either wikipedia should ignore remove Flair-Fujinami(but make a note that the NWA recognizes those supposed switches), or wikipedia should start the TNA lineage with Shamrock.

 ==AI isn't as bad as that== 
 I've seen lots of comments that the AI is really bad and will just blindly run into you to stay on its preprogrammed racing line.  As I do real racing in RL, I thought I would point out something about this.  What I have found is that the AI will respect you and change its line to avoid hitting your car when you are making a legitimate pass.  But if you're somewhere you have no right to be, it will take you out into the dirt where you belong.  And RL racers will do that, too.  It seems to me that most human players expect the AI to drive off the road and surrender positions to avoid contact with the player as they swing their car around wildly on the track to make inappropriate passes.  And it just doesn't.  Therefore, it's """"stupid"""".  But real drivers will punt idiots off the track, too.  Normally, drivers who don't know how to pass and be passed aren't allowed on the track in the first place.  That's what racing licenses are about.

Once I saw that I decided my stub needed to be a little better than decent so I've been working on it.

 During March and April 1959, at Wheeler's request, Everett visited Copenhagen, on vacation with his wife and baby daughter, in order to meet with Niels Bohr, the """"father of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics"""". The visit was a complete disaster; Everett was simply unable to communicate the core idea that the wavefunction should be regarded as a real classical field; this was simply heresy to Bohr and the others at Copenhagen. The conceptual gulf between their positions was simply too wide to allow any meeting of minds; Léon Rosenfeld, one of Bohr's followers, talking about Everett's visit, described Everett as being """"undescribably stupid and could not understand the simplest things in quantum mechanics"""". Everett later described this experience as """"hell...doomed from the beginning""""[5].""""

 For new articles or ones still at any early stage of development, the practice is a little looser, and any information that steers the article in the right direction tends to be seen as helpful. The punk rock article happens to be one of the most established articles on Wikipediathat little star on the top upper right of the article tells you it's a Featured Article, one of our best.

 These people sided with the Nazis (when they figured it suited there selfish and murderous interests best) and later, after the liberation of Greece, (to which the sacrifice of the lives of thousands of KKE members, partisans and sympathisers greatly contributed), they joined the new invaders, UK + USA, and formed another dictatorship to oppress the Greek people, and murder communists by the thousands. A regime which according to this pathetic article was legitimate (a legitimate fascist regime -)).

 First: To address Sterrettc's argument above: The argument that LGBT is not an """"organization"""" is clearly disingenuous. The premise of the argument to have the LGBT template removed is that the placement of that portal clearly violates neutrality of the article. It is clearly one faction whose intent was to have the policy lifted, and frankly, has nothing directly to do with the content of the article. There is no wiggle room for your position. 
 Second: To address Ruoyyssey's position: Linking it to this article is indeed an advertisement for the LGBT position. Again, try to get past your bias and look at the concept for what it is. For example; if a group that supported the ban, such as the United States Pastor Council (USPC) were to have their logo (image) with links to similar website located where the LGBT image ois located; I have no doubt that countless people who support the abolition on the DADT policy would be screaming to have the USPC image removed. Additionally, your reference to the occasional """"vandalism"""" suffered by the logo, demonstrates your need to simply skirt the primary issue. Images, web pages, and logos are vandalized every day on this website and well as numerous others. In fact, when someone emoved the website from the page and opted for a blank area for this DADT article, it was deemed as """"vandalism"""".

The interest in yiff, sexual human-animal roleplay and bestiality, etc, may be collectively caused by mixed fetishes and/or paraphilias towards animal traits or simple, although scientists are now debating over whether the sexual attraction to animal traits is a real sexuality or not, and if it is, on re-thinking sexuality altogether, as written in a recent article by the Scientific American.""",2,2602f28194da19a2

 == Response to Ebralph and nobs == 

 I have read all the posts and you have not addressed any of the issues to any satisfactory degree. Your primary assumptions derive from your wholesale and entirely uncritical acceptance of Klehr and Haynes, and others of the same outlook. You accept their narrow arguments at face value, with merely one bare note to the contrary. Nor is there any context. You appear to be unaware of the vast literature that surrounds the era, and thus are incapable of bringing in other comparative lines that might moderate your view. You are writing history here, you cannot merely throw in at the end one paragraph of Navasky and believe that mitigates the totality of the bias. 

 You spend your time diddling on the discussion page over which individuals were really espionage agents, while the article itself throws 349 in the wash, claiming as proven fact that they all had covert relations with the USSR. This is absurd. Not even Whittaker Chambers claimed Donald Hiss to be a spy, and to claim I. F. Stone, of all people, as an agent is merely insane. Ebralph's suggestion to me that I provide sources for the innocence of any specific named individual is again demonstrable of intent. You have merely taken the assertion of guilt based on names found in a file, then ask others to prove they are not. You cannot prove a negative. I cannot prove that you yourself are not, were not, a Soviet spy. One can only point out that the case provided comes nowhere near proving the assertion. 

 Many of your statements are just plain sloppy, which leads me to wonder just how well you know the field. What does it mean to say that Venona shows """"Ethel was guilty of cooperation""""!? It is utterly meaningless. There is no such crime as """"cooperation."""" The question is whether she was an accomplice by action or deed, and that remains just that, a question. Cable #1657 states openly that she did not work, but was aware of her husband's activity (which is not a punishable crime), neither did she have a code name, which points again to her not being involved. But, golly gee, despite the fact that this purports to be an article on the VENONA transcripts you neglect to mention what they actually say and merely assert a conclusion. This is not history, but diatribe.  

 Her brother has admitted to being coached to say that she did the typing  the prosecution needed that to tie her in, as mere knowledge of her husband's activities was not a crime. On Feb. 8, 1951, one month before their trial began Myles Lane of the Justice Department met with in secret session with the Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy. He informed them that the Department believed Julius was the """"keystone to a lot of other espionage agents"""" and that the only thing that would break him was the """"prospect of the death penalty."""" He then added that it was important to give Ethel """"a stiff sentence,"""" also as a means to break Julius, even though the case against her """"was not too strong. . .  it is about the only thing you can use as a lever against these people."""" At that the point the case against Ethel was nonexistent. They knew she was aware of Julius's work, but that was all. Eight days before the trial began her brother, under pressure from the prosecution, implicated Ethel in the sole act that would take her life  the typing of the notes. This, despite the fact, that up until then both Greenglasses had consistently asserted that the notes were handwritten. Years later, in a 1970s interview with author Ronald Radosh, the Greenglasses were hopelessly vague in remembering the typing incident, although they clearly remembered other events. Shocked to learn that it was the typing that gained Ethel the death penalty, Ruth said, """"It was almost as if we threw that in to involve her . . ."""" Again, you avoid all evidence contrary to your assertions, as if you ignoring it will make it disappear.  

 To state that """"their contributions to Soviet nuclear espionage were less important than was publicly alleged at the time"""" is to truly gild the lily. Julius's (not Ethel's) contribution was utterly useless, if not partly manufactured by the prosecution. The most damning piece of evidence against him was the drawing of the shaped charges, allegedly supplied to him by David Greenglass. Not only was this evidence absurd at the time, as one cannot reduce the information needed to a crude one-page sketch in any meaningful way, but the pertinent VENONA cable casts doubts that Greenglass ever presented the drawing at all (again, have you even read the transcripts? If so, why aren't they quoted?) Read VENONA #28, dated 8 Jan. 1945, then look to the timeline of the case as outlined by the prosecution. This cable covers the meeting at which Greenglass allegedly turned over the drawing to Julius, yet there is no mention of it at all.

 I noticed your remark that i should not call refer to an edit  on the page Nigger Fucker as """"vandalism"""" without just cause. I had just cause:  

 :* First you deleted about half the article.  

 ::*Your editorial note explaining the deletion was not accurate. You wrote: (Article cleanup: removing repetition, unsupported claims, and POV; returning focus to song rather than song writer). However, you removed almost all of the information about the song, in effect """"sanitizing"""" it of all content, and the description you left of the song was NOT accurate.  

 :::*The lyrics are not about a """"jilted husband"""" as you claimed. To jilt someone is to leave them at the altar bfore marriage.  

 :::* The lyrics are not about a man being left along to take care of his children as you claimed.  The song is not simply a racialized version of """"You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille""""  it is a song fusing race-hatred, and sexual jealousy. The children appear in one line; the bulk of the lyrics focus on sex acts and a white man's disgust at  his ex-wife's intimacy with a """"greasy nigger.""""  

 ::*The information that you deleted and """"sanitized"""" out of existence is central to the song, and it is not """"POV"""" or """"unsupported claims"""" or about the """"song writer"""" as you claimed in your edit note.  

 :* Second, on your next edit, a few minutes later, you suddenly inserted the name of Shel Silverstein, a well known Jewish poet, author and children's book writer, as the """"co-author"""" of the racist song """"Nigger Fucker"""" by David Allan Coe. This literally came out of nowhere. If you did not intend it as vandalism, i must say that it certainly looked like it to me, especially as it was added after you had already """"sanitized"""" the description of the song and had described it falsely. 

 Your irresponsible action in adding Shel Silvestein to the page caused the editor Entheta, who had originally created the stub, to have to go to the Shel Silverstein talk page to get the information that cleared Silversein of your charge of collaborating in anti-black racism / satire (take your pick).  

 I reverted the page to the last pre-vandalized version.   

 You then reverted the article back to your first, half-deleted and """"sanitized"""", version which falsely claimed that the song was abou a """"jilted"""" husband who was left to care for his children. 

 I have seen your apology for inserting the name of Shel Silverstein. However, for the reason that your current version is simply not an accurate description of the song, i am now going to revert the aticle again. I will not break the 3-reversion rule, but if you revert it again, i am going to seek mediation.  """,2,26ae73615f420c2e
